Simulate Marbles
==============

You have been given a death sentence in a foreign country. The night before your execution, you are brought two boxes, one containing fifty red marbles and one containing fifty blue marbles. All the marbles are the same size, weight, and shape. You are told that on the following day, the executioner will be blindfolded and will put his hand into one of the boxes and remove a marble. If the marble is blue, your life will be spared. If the marble is red, you will be executed.

You can arrange the marbles in the two boxes however you like, but you can't leave out any marbles, and you can't leave either box empty. Also, the executioner is known to take his time choosing a marble, so you can't improve your chances by stacking all the blue marbles at the top.

How can you arrange the marbles in the boxes so as to maximize your chances of surviving?

Program to simulate the correct marble distribution to maximize the best chances of surviving.
